	<h2>Context of the Campaign</h2>
	<br>
 <p>For our campaign, we mainly wanted to offer a (feminist) platform in which we spread Naya’s message about convincing women to say no (in sexually harassing situations). We wanted to do this in an amusing but above all educational way. We wanted to generate insights posts about the subject as mentioned above, but also offer a platform for girls to share their stories. Lastly, we wanted to share inspiring quotes, articles, and people from whom girls can hopefully learn something. Naya is a safe place to share your story, but at the same time, it is also a platform that is actively working on improving the situation of women in the world. <br> <br>
 We generated 6 posts a week (because a feed consists of 3 boxes, so 2 rows per week in total) that in an indirect or direct way says something about women's emancipation, sexual violence, and woman empowerment. Every day of each week had a different format. Think of a fact on Thursday, a news item on Monday, and a song recommendation on Tuesday. This is so that we maintain a certain structure in our page and followers know what to expect. Feed-wise it also looks really cohesive since each row is repeated every week which makes our page and feed visually attractive and structured. Besides promoting the channel on our private accounts, no further promotion was executed. <br>
	 <br>
The Goals established in our Marketing and Communication plan were as follows:
	 <br><br>
‘By the 14th of April we want to have reached 200 prospects (profile visitors) on the NAYA Instagram account.’
	 <br><br>
‘With Naya we want to create a safe place to share your story, and learn more about sexual abuse but at the same time offer a platform that is actively working on improving the situation of women in the world.’
	 <br><br>
‘Our goal is to reach 150 followers before the 14th of April.’
	 <br><br>
All these goals are set for Instagram, so we can focus our 100% on this. We thought long and hard about whether we wanted to add TikTok or Snapchat (given the results of our media behavior research) but finally wanted to go for quality instead of quantity. We believe that it is better to make a powerful Instagram in which a lot of time has been spent than half an Instagram account and half a TikTok channel in which we have placed 2 TikToks. We also think that Instagram is the best place for spreading our message and story

<h2>Learning Point</h2>
<p>
1. DO NOT START FROM SCRATCH. Let us start at the beginning. The start-up of our account. We did this from 0 followers. By promoting the instagram page on our own private channels, we soon found ourselves reaching 40 followers. Yet this was not enough to reach our goal of 150. We, therefore, switched to a different tactic. We started following different channels that were also followed by our followers. Because these accounts started following us back pretty soon, this resulted in an enormous increase in our followers. In the meantime (10-04) this number has reached 130 followers. Still, we are of the opinion that it would have been better not to start from scratch. We think it would have been better to reset an existing account (e.g. short movie account) and use that account. Then we would have started right away with 135 followers. 
 
2. Looking at the posts of similar accounts and the video commercials we posted ourselves, we have noticed that short video-related content is very popular. Followers are triggered and almost always finish the video. In retrospect, we should have done more with this. This can still be done within our concept (making a news video instead of an illustration) but will result in a higher engagement percentage.<br><br>
 
3. Investigating the possibilities of paid advertising on Instagram. We considered this but found it not worth the money. Still, it is a cheap way to generate a high engagement rate in a relatively easy and quick way.<br><br>
	
4. Because we used a lot of hashtags, we also got a lot of requests via DM and comments if we wanted to send our content to certain accounts. We didn't do this because we didn't think it was appropriate since we weren't a real brand, but in the future, it would be a very effective way to generate followers. These accounts already had something to do with women's rights and their followers are therefore high potential followers, too. <br><br>

5. The interim adjustment of postal times. What we have done now is that we post at the same time every day of the week (which was based on Instagram's statistics) even though these were the times when most of our followers were active on Instagram, we may have lost followers in the process. So what can help is to alternate these post times in between. Because concept proof our posts are the same, we can also examine this well and derive explanations from it.
</p><br>

<h2>Keeping Points</h2>
<p>
1. Maintaining our concept. Looking at the page, we think we have established a strong concept. The idea of posting the same format on fixed days gives the account a real clear page where followers know exactly what to expect. Looking at our goal (forming a community), this format certainly contributes to that.<br>  
2. Keep the use of hashtags. This gained interest by ‘college accounts’ that followed us immediately.<br>
3. Maintaining our high-intensity posting schedule. As a result, we have had relatively few recipients and our account has only grown exponentially.<br>
4. Using interaction in the stories. What you see is that profile visits increased when using an interaction poll (‘did you know this fact’). Also, asking our followers certain things in captions or stories increased profile views.<br>
5. The use of Tuesday Tunes. Looking at the reactions we have had, we think this was a real success. We could exilerate even more on this format. Maybe we can include our own Spotify list, podcast, or perhaps a concert. Sharing a certain type of music with the same theme in combination with the message we want to spread is a golden formula in our opinion.<br>

<h2>Future Planning</h2>
<p>During the past 2 and a half weeks of posting content on the Naya brand account on Instagram, we have kept a fluid and constant feed with a visual style guide that stays attractive to the eye of the audience. We were active on Instagram six times a week, from Monday to Saturday. We started posting on Friday, March 25th, 3 posts in which the Naya logo is divided to complete a full row of the Instagram feed. Included with those posts, we have added the brand vision and hashtags to increase our reach potential. We kept a specific and stable weekly schedule to keep our audience interested.
<br><br>We started the week by posting a News article every Monday morning and created the hashtag #MondayNews. The news articles were all recent and related to topics about violence against women, women in businesses, law regulations and anything else related to women empowerment and sexual abuse. In the story, we reshared our #MondayNews post with a link to the complete article to allow our audience and followers to read and inform themselves even more. On Tuesdays, we introduced Tuesday Tunes to our followers, by sharing 3 songs each week that were related to women empowerment and confidence, for example Run The World (Girls) by Beyonce or Confident by Demi Lovato, on our Instagram stories. In regards to the Instagram feed we posted a dictionary definition of empowering words, such as Confident, Empowerment, Feminist and more. Each Wednesday, we introduced powerful and successful women in different worlds of politics, music and media, and sports to inspire our target audience and help them become even more confident for their future and potential personal career. We also reshared the post in our stories later in the day in case the audience missed it. On Thursdays, we posted interesting facts about women that were potentially unknown to our target audience. To interact with our followers, we reposted the fact of the day on our Instagram stories with a poll, to ask whether they knew about it or not and so we could get more insights on our target audience’s knowledge. Every Friday, we introduced our brand products to our audience, so the hoodies and sweatshirts of Naya, worn by our different brand ambassadors and what they stand for. Finally, on Saturdays, we posted empowering quotes for our followers so they can start the weekend feeling confident and powerful. In the afternoons, we reposted the quote on our stories in case our followers missed it.
<br><br>For the first 10 days of posting, we posted at irregular times, as we hadn’t reached 100 followers on the platform yet to be able to see the followers insights and at what time our audience was most active. Once we reached the required amount of followers, we were able to adjust the posting times to our audience’s media behaviors and increase our reach.
<br><br>If the development of our brand Naya continued, we would keep up with the same visuals and content planning. From the customer feedback we have received, our target audience enjoys the aesthetic of our Instagram feed and benefits from the posted content. They learn new things, feel safe and confident when looking at our posts and the message we try to convey. Since our brand promotion is successfully working and targeting the right people, we decided to keep up with this strategy. Nevertheless, we aim to include new features to our feed and brand aesthetic for the future, to increase the follower interaction and the reach as much as possible. <br>For this, we would:<br>
- create Instagram Reels, a feature that allows to post videos of 15 seconds,<br>
- include paid promotions to advertise our brand Naya,<br>
- introduce giveaways of our brand product, with and/or without a partnering brand,<br>
- add the Instagram shopping feature to our feed to allow followers and non-followers to get to know our different available articles and to purchase them via the Instagram app,<br>
- create an account on the TikTok social media platform, on which we would share the same or similar content as we would create for our Instagram Reels. TikTok has great potential for our brand as the platform has 80 million active users, of which 60% are female and between 16-24 years old, so directly fitting in with our target audience (TikTok Statistics - Everything You Need to Know, 2022).<br><br>
When looking at our future content calendar, we have kept a similar weekly schedule for the future content we wish to post but have added a few changes, such as creating Instagram reels once a week, and include our first product giveaway during the fourth week of posting.The future calendar is not complete yet, as some posts can only be created shortly beforehand. 
<br><br>In regards to the things we would do differently, we should perhaps have created a TikTok account at the same time as the Instagram account. TikTok is the social media of the Generation Z, the generation our brand Naya is targeting. Besides this, Instagram Reels and TikTok videos are very similar and it is already common to see reshares of TikTok videos on the Instagram account. It is very clear that Instagram and TikTok are the most used social media platforms and any brand, whether new or old, can only benefit from it by adapting to the current trends and media behaviors of their target audience.
